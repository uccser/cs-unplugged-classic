title: Class Simulation of a Computer
type: page
---
*Note: This activity is a work in progress*

This activity exposes the idea that interesting things can be achieved using a simple instruction set and components, giving an idea of the underlying architecture of the computer.


**Variation:** introduce a bug in the code, and see how long it takes the class to realise that things aren't right

**Variation:** write some code to generate an interesting output (such as the Fibonacci series) and see if the "computer" can figure out what the program does.
